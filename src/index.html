    <h1 class="gradient-text">boxes: nikki giovanni | i am in a box
        on a tight string
        subject to pop
        without notice
        
        everybody says how strong
        i am
        
        only black women
        and white men
        are truly free
        they say
        
        it’s not difficult to see
        how stupid they are
        
        i would not reject
        my strength
        though its source
        is not choice
        but responsibility
        
        i would not reject my light
        though my wrinkles are also illuminated
        
        something within demands
        action
        or words
        if action is not possible
        
        i am tired
        of being boxed
        muhammad ali must surely be pleased
        that leon spinks relieved him
        
        most of the time
        i can’t breathe
        i smoke too much
        to cover my fears
        sometimes i pick
        my nose to avoid
        the breath i need
        
        i do also do the same
        injustice to my poems
        
        i write because
